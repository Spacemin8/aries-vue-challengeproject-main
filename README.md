## Objective

Design and implement an iOS & Android front-end for options strategy risk and reward analysis using Flutter.

## Brief

Your challenge is to create a Flutter component that can generate a risk & reward graph for options strategies. The component should accept an input of up to four options contracts and output the following:
1. A risk & reward graph where X is the price of the underlying at the time of expiry and Y is the profit/loss at that price. 
2. Max profit, max loss, and all break even points.

### Evaluation Criteria

- Completeness of the logic
- Usability of the graph
- Aesthetics of the UI
- Readability and code structure

### CodeSubmit 

Please organize, design, test, and document your code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the main branch.
